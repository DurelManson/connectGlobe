I will verify if the website content aligns with the provided PDF documents ("ConnectGlobe Applictions & Digital Marketing Content (1).pdf" and "Overseas Job Consultancy Content For Website (1).pdf").

### 1. Extract Content from PDFs
Since I cannot read PDF files directly, I will use the `pdftotext` tool (which I verified is available) to convert them into text files:
- `ConnectGlobe Applictions & Digital Marketing Content (1).pdf` -> `content_digital.txt`
- `Overseas Job Consultancy Content For Website (1).pdf` -> `content_consultancy.txt`

### 2. Analyze and Compare
I will read the extracted text files and compare them against the current website content, specifically focusing on:
- **Services Page (`services.html`):** Checking descriptions for "Manpower Consultancy", "Digital Marketing", and "Software Development".
- **Home & About Pages:** Ensuring the core value propositions and company descriptions match the source material.

### 3. Report Findings
I will provide a detailed summary highlighting:
- **Matches:** Content that is already correctly implemented.
- **Gaps:** Information from the PDFs that is missing from the website.
- **Discrepancies:** Any contradictions between the website and the documents.

I will then wait for your instructions to apply any necessary content updates.
