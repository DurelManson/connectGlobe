Our thorough recruitment process ensures the selection of the most suitable candidates through comprehensive evaluation, meticulous verification of identity, educational, and address proofs against original documents, followed by detailed reference checks to validate work history and qualifications--guaranteeing authenticity and excellence at every step.
Advance PCC Verification Systems
The Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) of selected candidates is verified to confirm they have no criminal record. PCC is an official document issued by police or government authorities certifying the absence of criminal convictions. The verification process involves submitting an application along with identity and address proofs, followed by a background check conducted by local police or authorized agencies. This may include physical verification, fingerprinting, and validation of details before the PCC is issued to ensure the candidate's clean criminal history.
